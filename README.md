# Python.Swarms
Swarm simulation

```
./game/app.py
```

or run in jupyter with

```
./notebooks/display_game
```

This is a fork of Python.Swarms, by elmar-hinz. I just made the display notebook and helper functions, and the navi_game file. It has utilities for building environments with goals and obstacles. Find my Neural.Swarms repo for neural network agents that learn to play the game. I'm hoping to train cooperative behavior, currently making strides with basic navigation.

From the original developer, elmar-hinz:

Framework to create differnt swarms by writing classes of swarm behaviour strategies.

The strategy can either result from the behaviour of the single figures (like ants, bees or robots)
or be fully supervised on the game level like in chess or be a combination of both like in economy, society or war.

The program uses python and curses. It will run on most Unix (Linux, Mac) but not directly on Windows.

It's coded with Python 2.7.11 on Mac OS X.
